            My name is Fernando da Costa, I'm 25 years old and I was born in Rio de Janeiro. Currently, I live with my parents, but I seek my independence. 
            To achieve this, I'm looking for a job in sports journalism, an area I've always been passionate about.

            My passion led me to create my own blog at the age of 15. 
            Running my own page, I had a harsh reality check. 
            Generating traffic was much more difficult than I imagined, but I had the perseverance, discipline and determination to face this problem head on. 
            I spent years studying SEO and today my blog receives over 10,000 daily visitors. 
            This was fundamental for me to become more humble, as I realized that success only comes after a lot of hard work. I try to carry this into my future.

            My dream is to have the opportunity to work in a sports journalism digital newsroom, to combine my two biggest passions: communication and sports. 
            I know this is easier said than done, but if I don't dream, then my life has no purpose. 
            To achieve my goal, I intend to continue using my blog to exercise my skills, but it has also helped me to understand certain elements of my personality that I also need to change.

            Especially when conducting interviews, I realize that I get a little nervous and in that I end up not developing my full potential. 
            In order to tackle this problem head on, I'm focusing more on interview content for my blog, as I believe practice makes perfect,
            so I'll practice as much as possible. I hope that my technical and personal development will be noticed by a sports journalism newsroom so that I can put into practice what I have learned as a journalist and as a person.
